# Sliding Window MSCKF
**Authors:** Doom

**!!!!NOTICE!!!!**
This implementation is still under constrution. Please DO NOT fork yet! 

MSCKF (Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter) is a well known Visual Inertial Navigation System (VINS) method, proposed by Anastasios I. Mourikis et al. I have great interest in using this method in my own project, but there are no available code yet. So I decide to create a complete implementation of this method using C++. However, the most tough part of MSCKF is the feature/keyframe culling, in order to make this code working efficently and easily, I use a sliding window instead.
